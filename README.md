## Note:

After Cloning the Project into your system, run below command in your CLI

```NodeJS
npm install
```

Because, this project is dependent on some Dependencies and those are included in node-modules folder, that folder is ignored while pushing into github because of its size. so, by running the above command it installs the necessary dependencies which are mentioned in the `package.json` file.

After running the above command run the below command mentioned in **Development server**

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
